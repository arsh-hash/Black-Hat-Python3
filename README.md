# Black-Hat-Python3 Book Source code 

This repository contains my implementations and improvements of the source code examples from the book **Black Hat Python** by **Justin Seitz**.
Unlike the original book examples, which were written several years ago, these versions are tested, modernized, and adapted to run smoothly with the latest Python 3.x releases and updated libraries.

The purpose of this repo is not just to mirror the bookâ€™s content but to:

- Provide a ready-to-use collection of offensive security scripts.
- Help learners understand how each concept works by running functional, updated code.
- Showcase improvements and best practices so the scripts are reliable in modern environments.
- Serve as a hands-on lab for anyone interested in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and Python-based security research.


# About the Project

- Based on the book Black Hat Python (2nd Edition).
- All examples have been rewritten, tested, and improved.
- Updated to work with modern Python 3.x and actively maintained libraries.
- Structured by chapters for easy reference and learning.


# Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Git
- Recommended: Linux/Kali environment for networking and security tools



#  Contribution

Feel free to fork this repo, improve the scripts further, and open pull requests.  
Collaboration is welcome!
