# Black-Hat-Python3 Book Source code 

This repository contains my implementations and improvements of the source code examples from the book Black Hat Python
 by Justin Seitz.

Iâ€™ve tested and updated all the code from the bookâ€™s chapters, ensuring compatibility with modern Python versions and libraries. My goal is to provide a practical, hands-on resource for security learners and practitioners.

Structured by chapters for easy reference and learning.
